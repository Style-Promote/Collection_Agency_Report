# Collection_Agency_Report
#I focus on the primary task of converting raw data, often provided in .txt format by ICICI Bank, to Singh Services, the authorized collection agency. I convert this data to Excel, then clean it, and allocate it to collection agents working for Singh Services. The agents then collect customer feedback, which I upload to the ICICI Bank CAPS system.
#I am not using the actual data; instead, I am creating virtual data that resembles ICICI Bank's data but is entirely generated by me. This virtual data is used to represent the work I performed, In Singh Services.
